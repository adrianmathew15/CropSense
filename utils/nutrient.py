    'Nitrogen': """Nitrogen deficiency is commonly characterized by yellowing of the older leaves and stunted growth. 
    <br/> Please consider the following suggestions:
    
    <br/><br/> 1. <i>Add organic compost or manure</i> – Organic materials like compost and well-rotted manure are rich in nitrogen and can help improve soil fertility.
    
    <br/> 2. <i>Plant nitrogen-fixing crops</i> – Crops such as peas, beans, and clover can help add nitrogen back into the soil naturally.
    
    <br/> 3. <i>Use urea or ammonium nitrate fertilizers</i> – Chemical fertilizers containing nitrogen can quickly address nitrogen deficiencies in soil.
    
    <br/> 4. <i>Mulch your soil</i> – Organic mulch such as grass clippings or leaves can help conserve moisture and improve soil nitrogen content over time.""",

    'Phosphorus': """Phosphorus deficiency typically leads to stunted growth, dark green leaves, and poor root development. 
    <br/> Please consider the following suggestions:
    
    <br/><br/> 1. <i>Apply rock phosphate</i> – This slow-release form of phosphorus is effective in correcting phosphorus deficiencies over time.
    
    <br/> 2. <i>Use bone meal</i> – Bone meal is a rich source of phosphorus that can be added to the soil to boost nutrient levels.
    
    <br/> 3. <i>Compost with high phosphorus content</i> – Some organic composts contain naturally occurring phosphorus that can enrich the soil.
    
    <br/> 4. <i>Ensure proper pH levels</i> – Phosphorus is most available to plants in soils with a pH between 6 and 7. Testing and adjusting soil pH can improve phosphorus availability.""",

    'Potassium': """Potassium deficiency is usually observed as yellowing or browning of the leaf edges and weak stems. 
    <br/> Please consider the following suggestions:
    
    <br/><br/> 1. <i>Use potassium sulfate or potassium chloride fertilizers</i> – These are effective sources of potassium and can address deficiencies quickly.
    
    <br/> 2. <i>Apply composted manure</i> – Manure is rich in potassium and can help replenish the soil over time.
    
    <br/> 3. <i>Use wood ash</i> – Wood ash contains potassium and can help raise the potassium levels in the soil.
    
    <br/> 4. <i>Increase organic matter</i> – Organic matter can improve nutrient availability, including potassium, in the soil.""",
